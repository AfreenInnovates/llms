# Fake News Detection with Fine-Tuned DistilBERT

This project demonstrates binary text classification using a fine-tuned **DistilBERT** model to detect whether a news article is **fake** or **real**.

## Model Output Examples

### Class Labels

```
{0: 'Reliable', 1: 'Unreliable'}
```

### Screenshots

Below are some sample screenshots showing the model in action:
